Android game application 

"Óνομα, Ζώο, Πράγμα" literally meaning "Name, Animal, Thing" is a well-known greek game. 
In this online version, the back-end of the app uses an online real-time database (Firebase) that allows the continuous communication between the devices of the players. 
On the front-end part of the application there is an UI made by my own custom graphics.
